# GetHiveCount-SizeOfTable
##### It's scala project.
##### I want to know how many more rows and sizes the table has each day.
##### So, I developed this program.
##### The goal of this program is to retrieve the rows and sizes of all the tables in Hive automatically.
##### But now, this program only supported get the rows and sizes of particular tables.
##### In the future, I will perfect tis program.
